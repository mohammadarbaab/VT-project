# ✅ Project Feature Checklist

## 🎯 Goal
Build and deploy a full-stack web app where a user can upload a video (≤250MB), store it on Firebase, transcribe it using AssemblyAI via backend, and view the transcript on the same page.

---

## 🧱 Functional Features

| # | Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|----------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | Single Page UI with Drop Zone | ✅ | Implemented using React Dropzone. Users can drag & drop or pick files manually. |
| 2 | Video File Validation (≤250MB) | ✅ | Validation added to allow only video MIME types & limit 250MB. |
| 3 | Upload Progress Bar | ✅ | Real-time upload progress shown using React state. |
| 4 | Firebase Storage Integration | ✅ | Firebase SDK v9 used to upload and get public URL. |
| 5 | Transcription API Integration | ✅ | AssemblyAI API used for transcription via Node.js backend. |
| 6 | Display Transcript | ✅ | Transcript fetched from backend and displayed dynamically. |
| 7 | Error Handling | ✅ | User-friendly error messages for invalid file / API error. |
| 8 | Responsive Design | ✅ | Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop. |
| 9 | Backend API (Express) | ✅ | `/transcribe` endpoint created to securely call AssemblyAI API. |
| 10 | CORS Handling | ✅ | Configured CORS for both local (localhost) and deployed domains. |

## 🌩️ Deployment

| Part | Platform | Status | URL |
|------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Frontend | Render | ✅ | [https://vt-project-du6f.onrender.com](https://vt-project-du6f.onrender.com) |
| Backend | Railway | ✅ | [https://vt-backend-production.up.railway.app](https://vt-backend-production.up.railway.app) |
| Firebase | Firebase Storage | ✅ | Used for secure video file hosting. |

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- API keys are **stored in `.env`** files and never committed.
- CORS configured to allow only trusted domains.
- Firebase rules restrict file size and type.
- AssemblyAI key secured via backend (not exposed to frontend).

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

- **ReactJS** for modern component-based frontend.
- **Firebase Storage** for scalable, reliable video hosting.
- **Node.js + Express** backend for secure API communication.
- **AssemblyAI** chosen for accurate and easy-to-use transcription.
- **Deployed** via Render (frontend) and Railway (backend) for simplicity and speed.
